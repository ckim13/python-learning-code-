###controlling execution with the break statement example 
Value = input ("Type less then 6 characters: ") ##the input finction allows the end user to input 
LetterNum = 1 ##
for Letter in Value:
	print("Letter ", LetterNum, " is ", Letter )
	LetterNum+=1 #note thati note the if function must match the 'for' function## 
	if LetterNum > 6:
		print ("Error too many letters!")
		break #the 'break' function breaks out of the loop and tells the application to stop executing 
        #meaning that it tells the application to stop after the function is done executing##

#listing items using the for and in functions allows python to loop through the items in a list 
persons = [ 'alice', 'david', 'marry', 'mark', 'jenny', 'robert' ]
for persons in persons:
    print (persons .title ( ) +  ", that was a great trick! " ) 
            
#the ".\n" command inserts a new line in the loop
    print ( "I can't wait to see your next trick, " + persons.title ( ) + ".\n")
#any line that isn't indented is only executed once without repeating 
print ( "thank you all so much for coming see you next week!")
